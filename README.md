#Description of the Data: 
Data was sourced from: https://www.epa.gov/national-aquatic-resource-surveys/data-national-aquatic-resource-surveys
The Data sets that will e used in the project are: 
    **1.)Streams 2004-2005; Benthic Macroinvertebrates; WSA Benthics Count (Part 1) - Data (CSV) &  WSA Benthics Count (Part 2) - Data       (CSV)**
          **What the Data is About**: Data shows the abundance of Benthic Macroinvertebrates in 
          **Variables that we will use**: Year of Collection, Order, Abundance, 
          **How the Data was Collected**: Data was collected from populations consisting of all streams and rivers that have flowing water              during the study period () within the 48 contiguous United States. All sites were samoled during base flow conditions. 
             Benthic macroinvertebrate samples were collected using a D-frame net with 500micrometer mesh openings. Individual samples                were taken from the sampling stations at 11 transects equally placed along the targeted reach. Sample material from all 11              locations was preserved with ~95% Ethanol solution. 
          *How the data will answer the research question*: Abundance data for the orders; Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera                  will be used to calculate an EPT index which will then be used as a biological index for water quality.

#Team Description:
    **Alejandra Monsivais Ibarra**: Alejandra is a student in her final year at the University of Toronto majoring in Ecology and                    Evolutionary Biology and Environmental Science. She is currently working on an Undergraduate research project that aims to              analyze ontogenetic growth patterns in 10 species of plants native to Ontario Grasslands and Tall Grass Praries. Her Skills              include; writing and modelling. Her responsibilities for the project will predominantly involve the writing of the final                Report. 
    
    **Adeena Zahid**: Adeena is a fourth-year undergraduate completing a double major in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology and Biodiversity            and Conservation Biology. She is part of the Gilbert lab where her research focuses on studying community convergence in                functional and species space in successional grasslands. Her skills include modelling and multivariate statistics. For this              project, her main responsibility will be data wrangling and manipulation, along with helping in other project tasks.
    
    **Jeonghoon Lee**: Jeonghoon is a fourth-year undergraduate student at the University of Toronto, completing a double major in Animal           Physiology and Ecology & Evolutionary Biology. Jeonghoon is currently working on an undergraduate independent project that               aims to determine the performances of functional beta diversity indices when confronted with various degrees and types of               errant data. His skills include mathematical modelling, statistical analyses, and computer programming. Jeonghoon’s                     responsibilities for the EEB313 group project are to adhere to the group’s code of conduct and to perform appropriate                   statistical analyses.
