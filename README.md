EEB313 2019 - Group Project

Group Members: Alejandra Monsivais Ibarra, Jeonghoon Lee, Adeena Zahid

## Introduction to the Project:
Water quality in rivers and streams has been found to vary accross spatial regions within the continental United States in response to a variety of factors such as agricultrual production, urban development and climate change (CITE, YEAR). The Mississipi River represents one of the most importnat waterbodies in the United States of America (CITE, YEAR).  Not only is it among the largest bodies of water in the United States, it serves an indespensible source of food, freshwater and  hydroelectricity for the states it flows through. Despite the undeniable importance of the river, in depth analyses of the factors that affect water quality along the entire length of the Mississipi have not been done. In fact, only segmental analyses of different parts of the river have been analyzed (CITE, YEAR). The purpose of this project then, is to build upon this repository of reseach and analyze water quality along the Mississipi River specifically in the 100km north of the Gulf of Mexico. Please see the section titled "OBJECTIVES.md" for the specific research questions this study will seek to analyze.
The indicator for water quality that will be used is the EPT index. This idex, defined as the proportion of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera found within a sampling site relative to all other taxa of Benthic Macroinvertebrates, has been shown to be a useful metric for water quality (CITE, YEAR). This is because, these three taxa represent highly sensitive organisms to any sort of physical or chemical disturbance in the watershed (CITE, YEAR). 
                
## Description of the Data: 
Data was sourced from: https://www.epa.gov/national-aquatic-resource-surveys/data-national-aquatic-resource-surveys
The Data sets that will be used in the project are:

 **1.)Streams 2008-2009; Benthic Macroinvertebrates; NRSA 0809 Benthic Macroinvertebrate MMI and Condition Class-Data (CSV)**
 
 **What the Data is About**: Data shows the abundance of Benthic Macroinvertebrates accross 983 sites within the continental United States. 
 
 **Variables that we will use**: Year of Collection, Order, Abundance, 
 
 **How the Data was Collected**: Data was collected from populations consisting of all streams and rivers that have flowing water during the study period () within the 48 contiguous United States. All sites were samoled during base flow conditions. Benthic macroinvertebrate samples were collected using a D-frame net with 500micrometer mesh openings. Individual samples were taken from the sampling stations at 11 transects equally placed along the targeted reach. Sample material from all 11 locations was preserved with ~95% Ethanol solution. 
 
 **How the data will answer the research question**: Abundance data for the orders; Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera will be used to calculate an EPT index which will then be used as a biological index for water quality.

**2.) Rivers and Streams 2008-2009; Water Chemistry; NRSA 0908 Water Chemistry-Data (CSV)**
 
 **What the Data is About**: Data shows chemical properties of Water accross 983 sites within the continental United States. 
 
 **Variables that we will use**: Water temperature, dissolved Oxygen content, nitrogen concentations, phosphorus concentrations. 
 
 **How the Data was Collected**: Readings of water chemistry were taken at a depth of 0.5 meters using multi-parameter water quality and conductivity probes. Prior to taking measurements, probes were calibrated using deionized and tap water. Measurements of Nitrogen and Phosphorus concentrations were obtained by taking water samples from sample sites, shipping them on ice to the Environmental protection agency lab where concentrations were measured. 
 
 **How the data will answer the research question**: Water Chemistry data will be used to deduce factors contributing to differences in water quality accross the selected sampling sites. For example, if nitrogen and phosphorus and dissolved oxygen concentrations are found to be higher in some locations than others, specifically in those located close to agricultural sites vs those that are not, then a deduction that high agricultural runoff is affecting water qualitiy can be made.

## Team Description:

**Alejandra Monsivais Ibarra**: Alejandra is a student in her final year at the University of Toronto majoring in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology and Environmental Science. She is currently working on an Undergraduate research project that aims to analyze ontogenetic growth patterns in 10 species of plants native to Ontario Grasslands and Tall Grass Praries. Her Skills include; writing and modelling. Her responsibilities for the project will predominantly involve the writing of the final Report.

**Adeena Zahid**: Adeena is a fourth-year undergraduate completing a double major in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology and Biodiversity and Conservation Biology. She is part of the Gilbert lab where her research focuses on studying community convergence in functional and species space in successional grasslands. Her skills include modelling and multivariate statistics. For this project, her main responsibility will be data wrangling and manipulation, along with helping in other project tasks.

**Jeonghoon Lee**: Jeonghoon is a fourth-year undergraduate student at the University of Toronto, completing a double major in Animal Physiology and Ecology & Evolutionary Biology. Jeonghoon is currently working on an undergraduate independent project that aims to determine the performances of functional beta diversity indices when confronted with various degrees and types of errant data. His skills include mathematical modelling, statistical analyses, and computer programming. Jeonghoon’s responsibilities for the EEB313 group project are to adhere to the group’s code of conduct and to perform appropriate statistical analyses.
