## USA sampling sites

*"USA Sampling sites.png"*

This map shows sampling sites for the National Rivers and Streams Assessment (NRSA) by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

## Mississippi river sampling sites

*"Mississippi River Sampling Sites.png"*

This map shows sampling sites for NRSA by the United States EPA along the Mississippi River. Sites included in our study are encircled in black and represent a 100km stretch of the river (north of the Gulf of Mexico).

## Scatterplot of EPT index versus water Nitrogen content

*"N_ept_scatter.pdf"*

This scatterplot shows the relationship between EPT indices and water nitrogen content. The relationship is predicted to be strong and negative. Each point represents an EPT index for one site and year.

## Scatterplot of EPT index versus water Phosphorus content

*"P_ept_scatter.pdf"*

This scatterplot shows the relationship between EPT indices and water phosphorus content. The relationship is predicted to be strong and negative. Each point represents an EPT index for one site and year.

## Scatterplot of EPT index versus water Oxygen content

*"O_ept_scatter.pdf"*

This scatterplot shows the relationship between EPT indices and dissolved oxygen content. The relationship is predicted to be strong and positive. Each point represents an EPT index for one site and year.

## Boxplot of EPT index versus site quality (based on water Oxygen content)

*ept_site_box.pdf*

This boxplot shows a comparison of the EPT indices across site quality. The site quality for this boxplot was based on dissolved oxygen content. High quality sites are predicted to have the highest EPT indices. Low quality sites are predicted to have the lowest EPT indices.
