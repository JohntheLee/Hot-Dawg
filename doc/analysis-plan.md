## Possible analyses

Create linear mixed-effects models to define the relationship between water quality and water chemistry. Must account for spatial autocorrelation. Calculate AIC values. Define fixed effects and random effects.

Calculation of correlation values.

Comparison of EPT indices across sites (Kruskal-Wallis H test).

Need to join the two datasets by site id. Summarize the data by year and site id. Select only the relevant variables. Mutate and form a new column for EPT index per site id per year.

## Possible results tables

Table of various linear mixed-effects models and their AIC values. Summary of the best fit model.

Table of EPT indices per site per year.

Output of Kruskal-Wallis H test for EPT index comparisons.

## Possible results figures

Linear regression models.

Fitted vs residuals models (to check for linear regression assumptions).

Boxplots of EPT indices.

Spatial (raster) plots of EPT indices across sites.
